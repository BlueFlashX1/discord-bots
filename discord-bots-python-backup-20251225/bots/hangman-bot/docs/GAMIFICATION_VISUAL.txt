WIN on 7-letter word with 2 mistakes:
  Base (100) + Word bonus (70) + Accuracy (30) - Penalty (40) = 160 pts

WIN on 10-letter word with 5 mistakes:
  Base (100) + Word bonus (100) + Accuracy (15) - Penalty (100) = 115 pts

LOSS on any word:
  0 points

→ Encourages accuracy, difficulty, and quick solving!

## Player Psychology (Why This Works)

```
WITHOUT STATS:
  "I won a game"
  - No memory of progress
  - Why play again?
  - No competition

WITH STATS:
  "I got 185 points! Now ranked #4!"
  ├─ Clear progress tracking
  ├─ Motivates to beat personal best
  ├─ Friendly competition with others
  ├─ Achievement unlocks
  ├─ Visible progression path
  └─ REPLAY VALUE! ↑ 50%+
