## 🎮 How Solo Leveling Features Integrate

### With Grammar System:

**Daily Writing Flow:**

```
1. Write 10 perfect messages
   ├─ ✅ Grammar Warrior quest progress: 1/10
   ├─ ✅ Grammar Warrior quest progress: 2/10
   ...
   └─ 📜 [QUEST COMPLETE] Grammar Warrior
      └─ 🎁 +100 pts, +50 XP, +1 stat point

2. Earn enough XP to level up
   ├─ 🎉 LEVEL UP! You're now Level 6!
   └─ ✨ [SYSTEM] Level up detected. HP fully restored.
      ├─ 💚 HP: 23/120 → 120/120
      └─ 💎 +1 stat point

3. Unlock new title
   └─ 👑 [SYSTEM] New title acquired: Wordsmith
      └─ Passive buffs: +10% points, +5% XP
```

### With Stat System:

**Title buffs multiply with stat allocations:**

Example: 9 Efficiency + Wordsmith title

```
Base points: 10
Efficiency bonus: ×1.45 (+45%)
Wordsmith bonus: ×1.10 (+10%)
Final multiplier: ×1.595

Result: 10 × 1.595 = 15.95 points per message!
```

### With PvP System:

**Titles affect combat:**

The Awakened title in PvP:

```
Base damage: 35
Title buff: +15% attack
Stat buff (9 Efficiency): +18% attack

Total damage: 35 × 1.15 × 1.18 = 47.5 damage
```

## 📊 Progression Comparison

### Traditional RPG vs Solo Leveling Style:

**Before (Traditional):**

```
Level up → +50 points, +1 stat point
(HP stays low, have to wait for regen)
```

**After (Solo Leveling):**

```
Level up →
  ✨ [SYSTEM] HP fully restored!
  💎 +1 stat point
  💰 +50 points
  📜 Quest progress tracked
  👑 Title buff applied

(Feels MUCH more epic!)
```

## 🎯 Daily Quest Strategy

### Optimal Quest Completion:

**Morning Routine:**

1. Check `/quests` to see daily objectives
2. Write 10 clean messages → Grammar Warrior (+1 stat point!)
3. Build a 5 streak → Streak Master
4. Fix any errors you make → Error Hunter
5. Do 3 PvP battles → PvP Challenger (+1 stat point!)

**Daily Rewards Total:**

- **525 points** (from all quests)
- **250 XP** (from all quests)

This means you can earn **2 extra stat points per day** just from quests! (vs 1 per level normally)
